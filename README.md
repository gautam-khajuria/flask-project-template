# flask-project-template

This is the example project using several flask features. To run, make sure you have a python anywhere account. Then, open a bash console at whichever directory you desire, and use `git clone https://github.com/gautam-khajuria/flask-project-template.git` to copy it in. Then just reload and run!

Code from Gautam Khajuria and Zoya Brahimzadeh for the Flask Workshop of the Bionic Bruins Hackathon '22.
